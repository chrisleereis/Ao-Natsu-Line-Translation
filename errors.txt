00kyoutsuu03 issues

	{0x0DF4} weird graphic transition, but i can't tell if its an error in the emulator or just present in the game like that, i assume this is vulcan rendering in Yuzu and probably not present on Switch

	{0x28D8} sms messages that are too long don't trigger a bubble outline

	{0x42CC} length 43, no bubble triggered for some reason
