## FAQ

### How was this made possible?

- It's important to note that we are a team of just two people, and this takes a large amount of meticulous work. This is our first time doing a translation of a video game, so keep that in mind too.

- We reverse-engineered the game assets to unpack them for modification. Afterwards we used [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/whydeepl) deep learning translation as a base for the dialogue. This was then cross-referenced by other translation software and proofread by people. While we strive for a high-quality translation, you may encounter small errors, and we encourage readers to contact us with any errors they find so we can patch it out.

### Will this patch work with the PS4, PSVita or Steam release?

No, this patch has been tailor-made for the Nintendo Switch version of the game. There is a chance the assets may be useful on other platforms, but will likely require heavy modifications.

### Why did you decide to translate this game?

Just felt like it, no other reason.

### Will you port the 18+ content of the game?

Due to the massive amount of work this would pose, we have decided not to.

### Are you working on any other projects now or in the future?

Blue Overture will continue developing the English language patch of Aonatsu Line for the forseeable future until it is complete. There are no other current projects, and there will probably be no other projects until development on this translation has ended.

### Where can I find a compatible copy of the game?
